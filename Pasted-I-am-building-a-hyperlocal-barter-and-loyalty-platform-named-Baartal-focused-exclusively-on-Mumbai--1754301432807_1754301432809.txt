I am building a hyperlocal barter and loyalty platform named Baartal, focused exclusively on Mumbai. The platform connects local businesses into curated "barter bundles" and lets customers earn and spend B-Coins (Baartal Coins) across those shops. Please generate a modern, professional, and mobile-first website that communicates the concept clearly, builds trust with merchants, and encourages both customers and businesses to join. The design should reflect simplicity, locality, trust, and movement (symbolizing exchange and flow).

🎯 Website Objectives:
Explain how Baartal works (for both merchants and customers)

Showcase regional bundles of local businesses

Drive signups for shopkeepers across Mumbai

Introduce B-Coins — our internal loyalty currency

Build credibility and excitement around the barter model

🧱 Website Structure:
1. Homepage Hero Section
Tagline: “Barter Smarter. Earn & Spend B-Coins Across Mumbai.”

Subtext: “Join a bundle of trusted neighborhood businesses and grow together through barter and loyalty.”

CTA Buttons:

“Join as Business”

“Explore Baartal Bundles”

Background: A visual/illustration of people shopping locally or exchanging services

2. How Baartal Works – for Customers
3-step illustrated flow:

Shop at a Baartal-listed business

Earn B-Coins with every bill (like cashback)

Use those B-Coins in any other bundle shop

Benefits: “Save more. Discover more. Support local.”

3. How Baartal Works – for Businesses
Explain the exclusive bundle concept (only 1 shop per category in each region)

Explain B2B barter capabilities: e.g., a salon exchanges service for ad space

Explain B-Coin loyalty system: “Offer customers B-Coins instead of discounts. They return or explore partners.”

Fee Model:

"Pay only when a customer uses B-Coins"

"More generous you are, less you pay"

"0 upfront cost"

CTA: “Apply to Join Your Area’s Bundle”

4. Why Merchants Love Baartal
Benefits listed in icons or cards:

✅ Free promotion through local bundle shops

✅ Repeat customers via B-Coin loyalty

✅ No risk — pay-per-use model

✅ Social media + WhatsApp exposure

✅ Community support & exclusive local presence

5. Explore Bundles by Region
Map view or list of 50 Mumbai regions

Each region shows:

Bundle name (e.g., Andheri West Circle)

Participating businesses (name, category, address, B-Coin offers)

"Join This Bundle" button if a category slot is still open

6. B-Coins Loyalty Program
“B-Coins are your new local loyalty currency”

Earned when you pay

Redeemable in other shops in your bundle

Never expires, can be saved or shared

CTA: “Start Earning B-Coins”

7. Merchant Testimonials (Placeholder Section)
2–3 testimonial boxes with photos, shop name, and quote

e.g., “I joined Baartal and got 20 new customers in a month — all from my own area!”
