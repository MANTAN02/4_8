# üß™ Google Authentication Testing Guide

## üìã Prerequisites
- Firebase project with Google authentication configured
- Google OAuth client ID: `1083312730280-hhl2ailg9v6276gm032af9jomf17h3vf.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Google OAuth client secret: `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`
- Baartal application running locally or deployed

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Login Page
1. Open your browser and go to the login page
2. You should see the "Sign in with Google" button

### 3. Test Google Authentication
1. Click the "Sign in with Google" button
2. A popup should appear asking you to select a Google account
3. Select or enter your Google account credentials
4. Grant necessary permissions if prompted

### 4. Expected Behavior
- After successful authentication, you should be redirected to the home page
- A success toast message should appear: "Google sign-in successful"
- Your user information should be available in the application

### 5. Verification Steps
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify that you're properly redirected after authentication
3. Check that the user's name/email appears in the navigation bar
4. Try accessing a protected route to ensure authentication is working

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Popup closed by user" Error
- Make sure to fully complete the authentication flow
- Don't close the popup window manually
- Try disabling popup blockers

#### 2. "Invalid client ID" Error
- Verify that the client ID is correctly configured in Firebase Console
- Check for any extra spaces or characters

#### 3. "Redirect URI mismatch" Error
- Ensure that your domain is in the authorized domains list in Firebase Console
- For development, localhost should be authorized

#### 4. Authentication Succeeds but User Not Logged In
- This indicates that the Firebase authentication is working but not integrated with the application's custom authentication system
- Check if the application needs a server-side endpoint to handle Firebase ID tokens

## üß™ Advanced Testing

### Test with Different Account Types
1. Test with a Gmail account
2. Test with a Google Workspace account
3. Test with an account that has never logged in before

### Test Edge Cases
1. Cancel the authentication flow
2. Close the popup window
3. Try logging in with an account that's not authorized
4. Test with multiple Google accounts
