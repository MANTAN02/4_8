                    B-Coins are Baartal's digital loyalty currency that you earn when shopping at participating businesses. 
                    Typically, you earn 3-8% of your purchase amount as B-Coins (set by each business). These B-Coins can 
                    then be spent at any participating business within the same bundle, giving you real value and flexibility 
                    in your local shopping experience.

                  <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
                    It's simple! When you make a purchase at any participating business:
                    <br />1. Look for the Baartal QR code at the checkout
                    <br />2. Open the Baartal app and scan the QR code
                    <br />3. Enter your bill amount
                    <br />4. B-Coins are instantly added to your account
                    <br />The business owner will confirm the transaction, and you'll see your B-Coins balance update immediately.

                    You can spend B-Coins at any participating business within the same "bundle" as where you earned them. 
                    Bundles are curated groups of local businesses in your area, with only one business per category 
                    (like one grocery store, one salon, one electronics shop, etc.). This means your B-Coins work across 
                    multiple types of businesses in your neighborhood.

                  <AccordionContent className="text-gray-700">
                    Currently, B-Coins do not expire. However, we recommend using them regularly to support local businesses 
                    and make the most of your loyalty rewards. We may introduce reasonable expiry periods in the future 
                    (like 12-24 months) with advance notice to all users.

                    B-Coins are designed as a loyalty reward system and cannot be converted directly to cash. However, 
                    they have real value when spending at participating businesses - essentially giving you discounts 
                    on your future purchases. This system is designed to support the local business ecosystem.

                    A Baartal bundle is an exclusive group of local businesses in a specific area (usually by pincode) 
                    with only one business per category. For example, one grocery store, one salon, one electronics shop, 
                    etc. This ensures no direct competition within the bundle while allowing businesses to share customers 
                    through the B-Coins loyalty system. Customers earn B-Coins at one business and can spend them at any 
                    business in the same bundle.

                    You can set your B-Coin percentage (typically between 3-8%) in your business dashboard. This is the 
                    percentage of each customer's bill that gets converted to B-Coins for them. Higher percentages can 
                    attract more customers, but you should set a rate that's sustainable for your business. You can 
                    adjust this percentage anytime based on your business strategy.

                    When customers spend B-Coins at your business, you receive the full cash value from Baartal. 
                    The B-Coins are essentially pre-paid by the businesses where customers earned them. You get real 
                    revenue while customers get to use their loyalty rewards. Payments are processed weekly through 
                    our secure payment system.

                    Yes, you can leave a bundle with 30 days notice. However, changing bundles is subject to availability 
                    in your desired area and category. We maintain the "one business per category per area" rule to 
                    ensure fair competition. Contact our support team to discuss your options if you need to make changes.
